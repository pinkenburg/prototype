Collection of reconstruction modules and macros for sPHENIX prototypes. 
The code management model follow that of the [sPHENIX coresoftware](https://github.com/sPHENIX-Collaboration/coresoftware). 
And these codes are separated from the `coresoftware` as they have distinct life cycle to fit the test beam analysis.
